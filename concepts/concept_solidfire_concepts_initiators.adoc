[.lead]
Initiators enable external clients access to volumes in a cluster, serving as the entry point for communication between clients and volumes. You can use initiators for CHAP-based rather than account-based access to storage volumes. A single initiator, when added to a volume access group, allows volume access group members to access all storage volumes added to the group without requiring authentication. An initiator can belong to only one access group.
