You can open a TCP port for an SSH reverse tunnel connection with NetApp Support. This connection enables NetApp Support to log in to your management node.

.Before you begin
* For management services 2.18 and later, the capability for remote access is disabled on the management node by default. To enable remote access functionality, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/element-software/mnode/task_mnode_ssh_management.html[Manage SSH functionality on the management node].

* If your management node is behind a proxy server, the following TCP ports are required in the sshd.config file:
+
[cols=3*,options="header",cols="15,25,60"]
|===
| TCP port
| Description
| Connection direction
| 443 | API calls/HTTPS for reverse port forwarding via open support tunnel to the web UI | Management node to storage nodes
| 22 | SSH login access | Management node to storage nodes or from storage nodes to management node
|===

.Steps
* Log in to your management node and open a terminal session.
* At a prompt, enter the following:
+
`rst -r  sfsupport.solidfire.com -u element -p <port_number>`

* To close the remote support tunnel, enter the following:
+
`rst --killall`

* (Optional) Disable https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/element-software/mnode/task_mnode_ssh_management.html[remote access functionality] again.
+
NOTE: SSH remains enabled on the management node if you do not disable it. SSH enabled configuration persists on the management node through updates and upgrades until it is manually disabled.
