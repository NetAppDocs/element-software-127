The Return To Factory Image (RTFI) process uses a bootable, installable media with a completely self-contained, minimalistic Linux OS to deploy Element software on a node. You can download the RTFI ISO image specific to your Element software version from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/element-software/downloads-tab[NetApp support site^].

After you download the RTFI ISO image, you can deploy it according to one of the following commonly used methods:

* *Physical USB key*: You can write a bootable Element software ISO to a USB key. For instructions, see the Knowledge Base article https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Hybrid_Cloud_Infrastructure/NetApp_HCI/How_to_create_an_RTFI_key_to_re-image_a_SolidFire_storage_node[How to create an RTFI key to re-image a SolidFire storage node^]. Insert the USB key with the ISO into the node and boot from the USB key.
* *Virtual media using the baseboard management controller (BMC) management port*: You can use the BMC to dynamically attach to the ISO located on your client system. The ISO is made available to the host OS as a virtual drive (CD or DVD).  For more information, see the Knowledge Base article https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Hybrid_Cloud_Infrastructure/NetApp_HCI/How_to_RTFI_a_node_via_BMC[How to RTFI a node via BMC^].
* *Network boot using a Preboot Execution Environment (PXE), Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), or FTP*: Instead of manually unpacking an ISO image, you can use `autofs` to automatically extract an image when the RTFI process requests it. This deployment mechanism requires more initial setup but allows for correct automation and scalability of installation.
