The following modes of replication are supported on the paired clusters:

* Asynchronous replication of data: The data sent to the replication target volume is sent asynchronously. The system does not wait for an acknowledgment to be sent before writing data.
* Synchronous replication of data: The data sent to the replication target volume is sent synchronously. When the I/O operations sent from the host are acknowledged by the system, the system acknowledgment is sent back to the host and the data is sent to the replication target volume.
* Snapshots-only replication of data: Only volume snapshots are replicated to the target cluster.
