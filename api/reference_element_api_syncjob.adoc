[.lead]
The syncJob object contains information about clone, remote replication, or slice synchronization jobs that are running on a cluster.

You can retrieve synchronization information with the `ListSyncJobs` API method.

== Object members

This object contains the following members:

[options="header"]
|===
|Name |Description |Type
a|
blocksPerSecond
a|
The number of data blocks being transferred per second from the source cluster to the target cluster. Present only if the type member is set to remote.
a|
float
a|
branchType
a|
Returned for remote replication sync jobs only. Possible values:

* snapshot
* volume

a|
string
a|
bytesPerSecond
a|
The number of bytes the clone is processing per second. Present only if the type member is set to clone or slice.
a|
float
a|
cloneID
a|
The identifier of the clone operation that is in progress. Present only if the type member is set to clone.
a|
integer
a|
currentBytes
a|
The number of bytes the clone has processed in the source volume. Present only if the type member is set to clone or slice.
a|
integer
a|
dstServiceID
a|
The service identifier hosting the primary replica for the volume. Present only if the type member is set to remote.
a|
integer
a|
dstVolumeID
a|
The destination volume ID. Present only if the type member is set to clone or remote.
a|
integer
a|
elapsedTime
a|
The time elapsed, in seconds, since the sync job started.
a|
float
a|
groupCloneID
a|
The ID of the group clone operation that is in progress.
a|
integer
a|
nodeID
a|
Specifies the node the clone is occurring on. Present only if the type member is set to clone.
a|
integer
a|
percentComplete
a|
The percentage of sync job completion.
a|
integer
a|
remainingTime
a|
The estimated time, in seconds, to complete the operation.
a|
integer
a|
sliceID
a|
The ID of the slice drive being synced.
a|
integer
a|
stage
a|
Present only if the type member is set to remote or clone. Possible values:

* metadata: Replication is in the process of determining what data needs to be transferred to the remote cluster. Status is not reported for this stage of the replication process.
* data: Replication is in the process of transferring the bulk of the data to the remote cluster.
* whole: Indicates backward compatibility of the slice for slice sync jobs.

a|
string
a|
snapshotID
a|
The ID of the snapshot the clone was created from. Present only if the type member is set to clone.
a|
integer
a|
srcServiceID
a|
The source service ID.
a|
integer
a|
srcVolumeID
a|
The source volume ID.
a|
integer
a|
totalBytes
a|
The total number of bytes of the clone. Present only if the type member is set to clone or slice.
a|
integer
a|
type
a|
The type of sync operation. Possible values:

* clone
* slice
* block
* remote
