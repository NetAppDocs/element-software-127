summary: 'The protectionDomainResiliency object contains the resiliency status of this storage cluster. Resiliency indicates the storage clusterâ€™s ability to automatically heal itself from one or more failures all within a single protection domain of its associated protection domain type. A storage cluster is considered healed when it can continue reading and writing data through the failure of any single storage node \(a state known as node tolerance\).'

The protectionDomainResiliency object contains the resiliency status of this storage cluster. Resiliency indicates the storage cluster's ability to automatically heal itself from one or more failures all within a single protection domain of its associated protection domain type. A storage cluster is considered healed when it can continue reading and writing data through the failure of any single storage node (a state known as node tolerance).
