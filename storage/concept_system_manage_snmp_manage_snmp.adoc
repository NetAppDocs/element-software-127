[.lead]
You can configure Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) in your cluster.

You can select an SNMP requestor, select which version of SNMP to use, identify the SNMP User-based Security Model (USM) user, and configure traps to monitor the SolidFire cluster. You can also view and access management information base files.

NOTE: You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
