You might need to update a replication relationship manually if an update fails because of a network error.

.About this task

You must specify the Element source path in the form `<hostip:>/lun/<name>`, where "`lun`" is the actual string "`lun`" and `name` is the name of the Element volume.

.Steps

. Update a replication relationship manually:
+
`snapmirror update -source-path <hostip:>/lun/<name> -destination-path <SVM:volume>|<cluster://SVM/volume>`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
[NOTE]
====
The command fails if a common snapshot copy does not exist on the source and destination. Use `snapmirror initialize` to re-initialize the relationship.
====
+
The following example updates the relationship between the source volume `0005` at IP address 10.0.0.11 and the destination volume `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:
