[.lead]
Whether you are replicating data from Element to ONTAP or from ONTAP to Element, you need to configure a job schedule, specify a policy, and create and initialize the relationship. You can use a default or custom policy.

The workflow assumes that you have completed the prerequisite tasks listed in link:element-replication-index.html#prerequisites[Prerequisites]. For complete background information on SnapMirror policies, including guidance on which policy to use, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/data-protection-disaster-recovery/index.html[Data protection overview^].
