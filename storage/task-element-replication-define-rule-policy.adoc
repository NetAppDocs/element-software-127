For custom policies with the "`mirror-vault`" policy type, you must define at least one rule that determines which snapshot copies are transferred during initialization and update. You can also define rules for default policies with the "`mirror-vault`" policy type.

.About this task

Every policy with the "`mirror-vault`" policy type must have a rule that specifies which snapshot copies to replicate. The rule "`bi-monthly`", for example, indicates that only snapshot copies assigned the SnapMirror label "`bi-monthly`" should be replicated. You assign the SnapMirror label when you configure Element snapshot copies.

Each policy type is associated with one or more system-defined rules. These rules are automatically assigned to a policy when you specify its policy type. The table below shows the system-defined rules.


|===

h| System-defined rule h| Used in policy types h| Result

a|
sm_created
a|
async-mirror, mirror-vault
a|
A snapshot copy created by SnapMirror is transferred on initialization and update.
a|
daily
a|
mirror-vault
a|
New snapshot copies on the source with the SnapMirror label "`daily`" are transferred on initialization and update.
a|
weekly
a|
mirror-vault
a|
New snapshot copies on the source with the SnapMirror label "`weekly`" are transferred on initialization and update.
a|
monthly
a|
mirror-vault
a|
New snapshot copies on the source with the SnapMirror label "`monthly`" are transferred on initialization and update.
|===
You can specify additional rules as needed, for default or custom policies. For example:

* For the default `MirrorAndVault` policy, you might create a rule called "`bi-monthly`" to match snapshot copies on the source with the "`bi-monthly`" SnapMirror label.
* For a custom policy with the "`mirror-vault`" policy type, you might create a rule called "`bi-weekly`" to match snapshot copies on the source with the "`bi-weekly`" SnapMirror label.

.Step

. Define a rule for a policy:
+
`snapmirror policy add-rule -vserver _SVM_ -policy _policy_for_rule_ -snapmirror-label _snapmirror-label_ -keep _retention_count_`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
The following example adds a rule with the SnapMirror label `bi-monthly` to the default `MirrorAndVault` policy:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror policy add-rule -vserver svm1 -policy MirrorAndVault -snapmirror-label bi-monthly -keep 6
----
+
The following example adds a rule with the SnapMirror label `bi-weekly` to the custom `my_snapvault` policy:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror policy add-rule -vserver svm1 -policy my_snapvault -snapmirror-label bi-weekly -keep 26
----
+
The following example adds a rule with the SnapMirror label `app_consistent` to the custom `Sync` policy:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror policy add-rule -vserver svm1 -policy Sync -snapmirror-label app_consistent -keep 1
----
+
You can then replicate snapshot copies from the source cluster that match this SnapMirror label:
+
----
cluster_src::> snapshot create -vserver vs1 -volume vol1 -snapshot snapshot1 -snapmirror-label app_consistent
