You might need to allow the following TCP and UDP ports through your data center's edge firewall so that you can manage the system remotely and allow clients outside of your data center to connect to resources. Some of these ports might not be required, depending on how you use the system.

All ports are TCP unless stated otherwise, and all TCP ports must support three-way handshake communication between the NetApp Support Server, management node, and nodes running Element software. For example, the host on a management node source communicates with the host on a storage cluster MVIP destination through TCP port 443, and the destination host communicates back to the source host through any port.

TIP: Enable ICMP between the management node, nodes running Element software, and cluster MVIP.

The following abbreviations are used in the table:

* MIP: Management IP address, a per-node address
* SIP: Storage IP address, a per-node address
* MVIP: Management virtual IP address
* SVIP: Storage virtual IP address
