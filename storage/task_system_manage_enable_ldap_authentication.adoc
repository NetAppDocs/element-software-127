You can configure storage system integration with an existing LDAP server. This enables LDAP administrators to centrally manage storage system access for users.

You can configure LDAP with either the Element user interface or the Element API. This procedure describes how to configure LDAP using the Element UI.

This example shows how to configure LDAP authentication on SolidFire and it uses `SearchAndBind` as the authentication type. The example uses a single Windows Server 2012 R2 Active Directory Server.

. Click *Cluster* > *LDAP*.
. Click *Yes* to enable LDAP authentication.
. Click *Add a Server*.
. Enter the *Host Name/IP Address*.
+
NOTE: An optional custom port number can also be entered.
+
For example, to add a custom port number, enter <host name or ip address>:<port number>

. Select *Use LDAPS Protocol*.
. Enter the required information in *General Settings*.

. Click *Enable LDAP*.
. Click *Test User Authentication* if you want to test the server access for a user.
. Copy the distinguished name and user group information that appears for use later when creating cluster administrators.
. Click *Save Changes* to save any new settings.
. To create a user in this group so that anyone can log in, complete the following:
 .. Click *User* > *View*.
+

 .. For the new user, click *LDAP* for the User Type, and paste the group you copied to the Distinguished Name field.
 .. Select the permissions, typically all permissions.
 .. Scroll down to the End User License Agreement and click *I accept*.
 .. Click *Create Cluster Admin*.
+
Now you have a user with the value of an Active Directory group.

To test this, log out of the Element UI and log back in as a user in that group.
