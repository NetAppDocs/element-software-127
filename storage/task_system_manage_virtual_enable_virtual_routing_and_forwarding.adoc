You can enable virtual routing and forwarding (VRF), which allows multiple instances of a routing table to exist in a router and work simultaneously. This functionality is available for storage networks only.

You can enable VRF only at the time of creating a VLAN. If you want to switch back to non-VRF, you must delete and re-create the VLAN.

. Click *Cluster* > *Network*.
. To enable VRF on a new VLAN, select *Create VLAN*.
 .. Enter relevant information for the new VRF/VLAN. See Adding a virtual network.
 .. Select the *Enable VRF* check box.
 .. *Optional*: Enter a gateway.
. Click *Create VLAN*.
