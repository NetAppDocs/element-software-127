For clusters running Element software, real-time replication enables the quick creation of remote copies of volume data. You can pair a storage cluster with up to four other storage clusters. You can replicate volume data synchronously or asynchronously from either cluster in a cluster pair for failover and failback scenarios.

The replication process includes these steps:
