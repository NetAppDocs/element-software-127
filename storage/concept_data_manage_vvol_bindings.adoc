To perform I/O operations with a virtual volume, an ESXi host must first bind the virtual volume.

The SolidFire cluster chooses an optimal protocol endpoint, creates a binding that associates the ESXi host and virtual volume with the protocol endpoint, and returns the binding to the ESXi host. After it is bound, the ESXi host can perform I/O operations with the bound virtual volume.
