You can delete a QoS policy if it is no longer needed. When you delete a QoS policy, all volumes associated with the policy maintain the QoS settings but become unassociated with a policy.

NOTE: If you are trying instead to disassociate a volume from a QoS policy, you can change the QoS settings for that volume to custom.

. Select *Management* > *QoS Policies*.
. Click the Actions icon for the QoS policy you want to delete.
. In the resulting menu, select *Delete*.
. Confirm the action.
