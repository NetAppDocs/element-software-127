Setting up the Network Time Protocol (NTP) can be achieved in one of two ways: either instruct each node in a cluster to listen for broadcasts or or instruct each node to query an NTP server for updates.

The NTP is used to synchronize clocks over a network. Connection to an internal or external NTP server should be part of the initial cluster setup.
