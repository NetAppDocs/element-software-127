[.lead]
You need to resynchronize a replication relationship after you make a destination volume writeable, after an update fails because a common Snapshot copy does not exist on the source and destination volumes, or if you want to change the replication policy for the relationship.

.About this task

Although resync does not require a baseline transfer, it can be time-consuming. You might want to run the resync in off-peak hours.

You must specify the Element source path in the form `<hostip:>/lun/<name>`, where "`lun`" is the actual string "`lun`" and `name` is the name of the Element volume.

.Step

. Resync the source and destination volumes:
+
`snapmirror resync -source-path <hostip:>/lun/<name> -destination-path <SVM:volume>|<cluster://SVM/volume> -type XDP -policy <policy>`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
The following example resyncs the relationship between the source volume `0005` at IP address 10.0.0.11 and the destination volume `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:

cluster_dst::> snapmirror resync -source-path 10.0.0.11:/lun/0005 -policy MirrorLatest -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
