The SolidFire system puts a drive in a failed state if the drive's self-diagnostics tells the node it has failed or if communication with the drive stops for five and a half minutes or longer. The system displays a list of the failed drives. You must remove a failed drive from the failed drive list in NetApp Element software.

Drives in the *Alerts* list show as *blockServiceUnhealthy* when a node is offline. When restarting the node, if the node and its drives come back online within five and a half minutes, the drives automatically update and continue as active drives in the cluster.
