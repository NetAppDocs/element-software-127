To prepare for enabling the FIPS drives feature, you should avoid mixing nodes where some are FIPS drives capable and some are not.

A cluster is considered FIPS drives compliant based on the following conditions:

* All drives are certified as FIPS drives.
* All nodes are FIPS drives nodes.
* Encryption at Rest (EAR) is enabled.
* The FIPS drives feature is enabled. All drives and nodes must be FIPS capable and Encryption at Rest must be enabled in order to enable the FIPS drive feature.
