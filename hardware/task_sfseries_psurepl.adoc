Each SolidFire chassis includes two power supply units for power redundancy. If a power supply unit fails, you should replace it as soon as possible to ensure that the chassis has a redundant power source.

.What you'll need

* You have determined that the power supply unit needs to be replaced.
* You have a replacement power supply unit.
* You have verified that the second power supply unit is operating.
* You have an electrostatic discharge (ESD) wristband, or you have taken other antistatic precautions.

.About this task

The instructions apply if you have a one-rack unit (1U) chassis with any of the following nodes:

* SF2405
* SF4805
* SF9605
* SF9608
* SF19210
* SF38410
* SF-FCN-01
* FC0025

[NOTE]
====
Depending on your Element software version, the following nodes are not supported:

* Beginning with Element 12.7, SF2405 and SF9608 storage nodes and FC0025 and SF-FCN-01 FC nodes. 
* Beginning with Element 12.0, SF3010, SF6010, and SF9010 storage nodes.

.Steps

. Unplug the power cord from the power supply unit that you are replacing.
. Press the release button to slide the power supply unit out of the chassis.
+
IMPORTANT: Ensure that you use both hands to support the weight of the power supply unit.

. Using both hands, align the edges of the replacement power supply unit with the opening in the chassis, and gently push the unit into the chassis.
+
IMPORTANT: Do not use excessive force when sliding the power supply unit into the chassis to prevent damage to the hardware.

. Plug in the power cord.
. Return the failed unit to NetApp by following the instructions in the box that was shipped to you.
+
You can contact NetApp Support for help with the replacement procedure.
